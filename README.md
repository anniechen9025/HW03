#### Code style

Javascript


### Summary

I had set up several arrays to help to hold the possible letters will be pops up in the password generator. knowing when calling items from array we need to have loop function to get it. also using if else function to set up the situations that we want to have at least one type of characters get selected. finally by understanding the codes being given to arrange our function to fit in the code to help to show the result of random password to show on the website text box.
